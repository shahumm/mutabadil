		"description": "A few years ago, love for soup inspired us to create and perfect the recipe of a quick dissolving chicken powder. The launch of this chicken powder required a name and “Dashi“ being a specific type of stock, essential for all Japanese soups, was an appropriate choice. Appreciation for quality and taste from the consumers lead us to move ahead and today we are known as the pioneers of the said category in Pakistan."
